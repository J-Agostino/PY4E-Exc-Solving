# PY4E-Exc-Solving
While following the Python for Everybody course, by Dr. Chuck, I also want to learn how Git works. So this will be my journal about Python exrcesices as I understand how Github works.

I've actually made this course the last year, but now I'm taking it seriously. I hope that I can inspire and help people who are struggling to learn programming.

Since I'm still not a pro, this content may have mistakes or things to improve, if you find anything let me know!

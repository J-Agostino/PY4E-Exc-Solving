# PY4E-Exc-Solving
While following the Python for Everybody course, by Dr. Chuck, I also want to learn how Git works. So this will be my journal about Python exercises as I understand how Github works.

I actually made this course in 2021, but now I'm taking it seriously. I hope that I can inspire and help people who are struggling to learn programming.

IMPORTANT 

If you try to run the files entirely they will not work, if you want to use them you'll need to select and copy the exercise one by one and make a new Python file.
